        <h2 style="color:brown">Employment History</h2>
        <p>
            I am a 30-something employee of Rocket Mortgage in southeast Detroit since 2016 who studied English and Writing in college then proceeded to work in customer service for a few years before landing my first office job at Rocket Mortgage (then Quicken Loans). I am currently part of a tech team called <b>The Answer</b> as a <i>Change Implementer</i>, working on an industry tool developed by the company called Pathfinder.

        <h2 style="color:brown">KG: Origins</h2>
        <p>
            I am a native Michigander and have never lived in any other state but the one that's shaped like a hand. I grew up in a suburb of Detroit called Royal Oak, attended college on the other side of the state in Grand Rapids, then returned to the east side of Michigan where I currently reside. I commute downtown for work but live in a city called <i>Madison Heights</i>.
        </p>
        <h2 style="color:brown">Bookish</h2>
        <p>
            As a lifelong book nerd, I sought out ways to continue expressing my love of books after college, even though I did not pursue a career in teaching or literature. For years, this manifested in a blog where I posted book reviews of every book I read for several years in my mid-20s, called <a href="https://mystateisahand.blogspot.com/"><i>Musings From the Mitten</i></a>. This is the first time I dipped my toes into coding, although at a very basic level and using a site that was very intuitive.
